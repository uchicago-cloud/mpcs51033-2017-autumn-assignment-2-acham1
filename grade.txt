  [x] Update API calls to pass token

[x] Add delete photo API
[x] Photo labeling with Google Vision

Great job on this assignment.  It took me a bit to realize that any username
and password would return a token, but after that, I was able to test everything
and it worked great.

Nice work creating a base class for your handlers.  Made the implementation very
clean and would be easier to maintain in the future.  I think that I will have
to add this to my "GAE best practices" slides for next year.

Cloud storage worked great locally, so I assume it was working on the deployed
version since I could upload images.  I was unimpressed with the Cloud Vision
results.  I uploaded a picture of a dog and all it found was "mammal".  It did
identify grass, which I guess is a really unexciting accomplishment.

Grade: 10/10
